- : how I solve it

*  Retrieve (`GET`) data from to `/gallery` and store it in `App.js`.
    -  Frist, I go to the file `gallery.data.js` in modules folder to save my pictures the data in server. 
    -  Then I go to `App.js` file to show my pictures with tag pair <img>.
    -  And to get my picture data. I have to create an GET request inside the component class to get my picture data from server. Beside send the GET request, I also create an state object to save / store my data which I will pull from server over.
